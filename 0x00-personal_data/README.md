**0x00. Personal Data**

**Project Description:**

The 0x00. Personal Data project is a back-end authentication project designed to teach students about handling personal data securely in software applications. The project will be led by Emmanuel Turlay, a Staff Software Engineer at Cruise. The goal of this project is to enable students to understand and implement best practices related to personally identifiable information (PII) handling, log filtering, password encryption, and database authentication using environment variables.

**Learning Objectives:**

Upon completing this project, students should be able to explain the following concepts without using external resources:

- Examples of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
- How to implement a log filter that obfuscates PII fields
- How to encrypt a password and validate input passwords
- How to authenticate to a database using environment variables

**Requirements:**

- Operating System: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- Programming Language: Python3 (version 3.7)
- File Format: All files should end with a new line
- Shebang: The first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- README.md: A mandatory README.md file at the root of the project folder
- Code Style: Follow Pycodestyle (version 2.5) for coding style
- File Execution: All files must be executable
- Documentation: Provide documentation for modules, classes, and functions with clear explanations
- Type Annotations: All functions should be type annotated
- Logging: Use logging to handle logs effectively
- Password Encryption: Use the bcrypt package to encrypt passwords
- Database Authentication: Authenticate to the database using environment variables

**Resources:**

Students should read or watch the following resources to prepare for the project:

1. [What Is PII, non-PII, and Personal Data?](https://piwik.pro/blog/what-is-pii-personal-data/)
2. [Logging Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html)
3. [bcrypt Package](https://github.com/pyca/bcrypt/)
4. [Logging to Files, Setting Levels, and Formatting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ARI4Cz-awo)

**Project Setup:**

1. Clone the project repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abiodun001-world/alx-backend-user-data.git/
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.
```bash
cd 0x00-personal_data
```

3. Ensure you have Python3 (version 3.7) and necessary packages installed.

**Project Structure:**

The project should be organized in a clear and logical folder structure. Each functionality should have its module or class with appropriate documentation.

**Additional Notes:**

- Personal data protection and security are critical aspects of software development. It is crucial to understand and apply best practices to handle user information securely and responsibly.

**Good luck with the project! Happy coding!**
