# 0x02. Session Authentication

**Back-end Authentication Project**

## Background Context

In this project, you will implement Session Authentication without using any additional modules. While it's recommended to use established modules or frameworks for session authentication in real-world scenarios, this project aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the mechanism by building it from scratch.

### Resources

Before you begin, make sure to read or watch the following resources:

- [REST API Authentication Mechanisms - Session Auth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=501dpx2IjGY)
- [HTTP Cookie](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cookie)
- [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/)
- [Flask Cookie](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/#cookies)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without relying on external resources:

- The concept of authentication
- Session authentication and its significance
- What Cookies are in web development
- How to send Cookies to clients
- How to parse and manage Cookies

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Your code will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3.7
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of each file must be `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- Your code should adhere to the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5)
- All files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using the `wc` command
- All modules, classes, and functions should have meaningful documentation explaining their purpose

### Documentation Guidelines

- To print the documentation of a module: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`
- To print the documentation of a class: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`
- To print the documentation of a function: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`
- Documentation should be descriptive sentences explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method

### Mandatory Files

- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder

## Project Instructions

1. Implement Session Authentication from scratch without using external modules.
2. Follow the documentation and style guidelines provided.
3. Ensure your code is executable and adheres to the specified requirements.
4. Create a detailed `README.md` file to document your project.
