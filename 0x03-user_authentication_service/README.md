# 0x03. User Authentication Service

## Overview

The **0x03 User Authentication Service** project is a part of the curriculum designed by Holberton School Africa in collaboration with ALX. The project aims to provide hands-on experience in understanding and implementing user authentication mechanisms in a Flask-based back-end application. In this project, you will learn about API routes, cookies, request form data, HTTP status codes, and more.

This project is developed by Emmanuel Turlay, a Staff Software Engineer at Cruise, and is intended to enhance your knowledge and skills in building secure and efficient authentication systems.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you are expected to achieve the following learning objectives:

- Understand how to declare API routes in a Flask application.
- Gain proficiency in working with cookies to manage user sessions.
- Learn how to retrieve and process request form data.
- Master the art of returning various HTTP status codes for effective communication with clients.

## Resources

Before you dive into the project, make sure to familiarize yourself with the following resources:

- [Flask Documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/)
- [Requests Module](https://requests.kennethreitz.org/en/latest/user/quickstart/)
- [HTTP Status Codes](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html)

## Project Structure

This project consists of the following components:

1. **Authentication Mechanism:** Gain insights into the process of user authentication.
2. **API Routes:** Learn how to declare and manage API routes within a Flask application.
3. **Cookie Management:** Understand how to work with cookies for session management.
4. **HTTP Status Codes:** Explore the usage of HTTP status codes for effective communication.

## Project Requirements

To successfully complete this project, ensure that you fulfill the following requirements:

- Use one of the allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All files should be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.7).
- All files must end with a new line.
- The first line of each file should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- Maintain a `README.md` file at the root of the project folder with project details.
- Adhere to the `pycodestyle` style guide (version 2.5) for code formatting.
- Utilize SQLAlchemy version 1.3.x for database interactions.
- Ensure all your files are executable.
- Document all your modules, classes, and functions with meaningful explanations.
- Use type annotations for all your functions.
- The Flask app should only interact with the `Auth` module and not directly with the database (`DB`).
- Only public methods of `Auth` and `DB` should be used outside these classes.

## Setup

Before you start working on the project, make sure to install the `bcrypt` library using the following command:

```bash
pip3 install bcrypt
```

## Project Evaluation

At the end of this project, you will be evaluated on your understanding of API routes, cookies, request form data, and HTTP status codes. Your code will also be reviewed based on adherence to coding standards, documentation, and proper usage of the `bcrypt` library.

Good luck, and enjoy exploring the world of user authentication in Flask! If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to your mentors or fellow students. Happy coding! ðŸš€
